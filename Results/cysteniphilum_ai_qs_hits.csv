QS,WHN65998.1,hypothetical protein NYP54_01865 [Cysteiniphilum sp. QT6929],SUPERFAMILY,C-terminal effector domain of the bipartite response regulators,IPR016032,"Signal transduction response regulator, C-terminal effector","Two-component signal transduction systems enable bacteria to sense, respond, and adapt to a wide range of environments, stressors, and growth conditions [[cite:PUB00042804]].  Some bacteria can contain up to as many as 200 two-component systems that need tight regulation to prevent unwanted cross-talk [[cite:PUB00042805]]. These pathways have been adapted to response to a wide variety of stimuli, including nutrients, cellular redox state, changes in osmolarity, quorum signals, antibiotics, and more [[cite:PUB00010651]]. Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]]. The HK catalyses its own auto-phosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. Some HK are bifunctional, catalysing both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their cognate RR. The input stimuli can regulate either the kinase or phosphatase activity of the bifunctional HK.

A variant of the two-component system is the phospho-relay system. Here a hybrid HK auto-phosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to an internal receiver domain, rather than to a separate RR protein. The phosphoryl group is then shuttled to histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) and subsequently to a terminal RR, which can evoke the desired response [[cite:PUB00042806], [cite:PUB00042807]]. This entry represents a structural domain usually found at the C-terminal of bipartite response regulators. These proteins are known to bind to DNA and RNA polymerases, and their N-terminal receiver domain belongs to the CheY family. The C-terminal effector domain consists of a 3-helical bundle in an up-an-down arrangement with a right-handed twist. This domain occurs in:




PhoB-like proteins, which includes PhoB [[cite:PUB00013308]], OmpR [[cite:PUB00022327]], and DrrB [[cite:PUB00022388]]; these proteins contain a 4-stranded meander β-sheet in the N-terminal extension.



GerE-like proteins from the LuxR/UhpA family of proteins, which includes GerE [[cite:PUB00016941]], TraR (quorum-sensing) [[cite:PUB00016950]], NarL (nitrate/nitrite response regulator) [[cite:PUB00036081]], and RcsB transcriptional regulator [[cite:PUB00016947]]; these proteins contain an additional fourth helix in the C-terminal extension.

Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]]. The HK catalyses its own auto-phosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. Some HK are bifunctional, catalysing both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their cognate RR. The input stimuli can regulate either the kinase or phosphatase activity of the bifunctional HK.

A variant of the two-component system is the phospho-relay system. Here a hybrid HK auto-phosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to an internal receiver domain, rather than to a separate RR protein.

Some bacteria can contain up to as many as 200 two-component systems that need tight regulation to prevent unwanted cross-talk [[cite:PUB00042805]]. These pathways have been adapted to response to a wide variety of stimuli, including nutrients, cellular redox state, changes in osmolarity, quorum signals, antibiotics, and more [[cite:PUB00010651]]. Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]]. The HK catalyses its own auto-phosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. Some HK are bifunctional, catalysing both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their cognate RR. The input stimuli can regulate either the kinase or phosphatase activity of the bifunctional HK.

A variant of the two-component system is the phospho-relay system. Here a hybrid HK auto-phosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to an internal receiver domain, rather than to a separate RR protein. The phosphoryl group is then shuttled to histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) and subsequently to a terminal RR, which can evoke the desired response [[cite:PUB00042806], [cite:PUB00042807]].

The domain is named after Vibrio fischeri luxR, a transcriptional activator for quorum-sensing control of luminescence. LuxR-type HTH domain proteins occur in a variety of organisms. The DNA-binding HTH domain is usually located in the C-terminal region; the N-terminal region often containing an autoinducer-binding domain or a response regulatory domain. Most luxR-type regulators act as transcription activators, but some can be repressors or have a dual role for different sites. LuxR-type HTH regulators control a wide variety of activities in various biological processes.



The luxR-type, DNA-binding HTH domain forms a four-helical bundle structure. The HTH motif comprises the second and third helices, known as the scaffold and recognition helix, respectively. The HTH binds DNA in the major groove, where the N-terminal part of the recognition helix makes most of the DNA contacts. The fourth helix is involved in dimerisation of gerE and traR. Signalling events by one of the four activation mechanisms described below lead to multimerisation of the regulator. The regulators bind DNA as multimers [[cite:PUB00016941], [cite:PUB00016947], [cite:PUB00016946]].



LuxR-type HTH proteins can be activated by one of four different mechanisms:



1) Regulators which belong to a two-component sensory transduction system where the protein is activated by its phosphorylation, generally on an aspartate residue, by a transmembrane kinase [[cite:PUB00016942], [cite:PUB00016943]]. Some proteins that belong to this category are:

2) Regulators which are activated, or in very rare cases repressed, when bound to N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are used as quorum sensing molecules in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00016944]]:

Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]].

A variant of the two-component system is the phospho-relay system.

The domain is named after Vibrio fischeri luxR, a transcriptional activator for quorum-sensing control of luminescence. LuxR-type HTH domain proteins occur in a variety of organisms. The DNA-binding HTH domain is usually located in the C-terminal region; the N-terminal region often containing an autoinducer-binding domain or a response regulatory domain. Most luxR-type regulators act as transcription activators, but some can be repressors or have a dual role for different sites. LuxR-type HTH regulators control a wide variety of activities in various biological processes.



The luxR-type, DNA-binding HTH domain forms a four-helical bundle structure. The HTH motif comprises the second and third helices, known as the scaffold and recognition helix, respectively. The HTH binds DNA in the major groove, where the N-terminal part of the recognition helix makes most of the DNA contacts. The fourth helix is involved in dimerisation of gerE and traR. Signalling events by one of the four activation mechanisms described below lead to multimerisation of the regulator. The regulators bind DNA as multimers [[cite:PUB00016941], [cite:PUB00016947], [cite:PUB00016946]].



LuxR-type HTH proteins can be activated by one of four different mechanisms:



1) Regulators which belong to a two-component sensory transduction system where the protein is activated by its phosphorylation, generally on an aspartate residue, by a transmembrane kinase [[cite:PUB00016942], [cite:PUB00016943]]. Some proteins that belong to this category are:

These pathways have been adapted to response to a wide variety of stimuli, including nutrients, cellular redox state, changes in osmolarity, quorum signals, antibiotics, and more [[cite:PUB00010651]]. Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]]. The HK catalyses its own auto-phosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. Some HK are bifunctional, catalysing both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their cognate RR.

QT6929],ProSitePatterns,LuxR-type HTH domain signature.,IPR000792,"Transcription regulator LuxR, C-terminal","This domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of about 65 amino acids, present in transcription regulators of the LuxR/FixJ family of response regulators. The domain is named after Vibrio fischeri luxR, a transcriptional activator for quorum-sensing control of luminescence. LuxR-type HTH domain proteins occur in a variety of organisms. The DNA-binding HTH domain is usually located in the C-terminal region; the N-terminal region often containing an autoinducer-binding domain or a response regulatory domain. Most luxR-type regulators act as transcription activators, but some can be repressors or have a dual role for different sites. LuxR-type HTH regulators control a wide variety of activities in various biological processes.



The luxR-type, DNA-binding HTH domain forms a four-helical bundle structure. The HTH motif comprises the second and third helices, known as the scaffold and recognition helix, respectively. The HTH binds DNA in the major groove, where the N-terminal part of the recognition helix makes most of the DNA contacts. The fourth helix is involved in dimerisation of gerE and traR. Signalling events by one of the four activation mechanisms described below lead to multimerisation of the regulator. The regulators bind DNA as multimers [[cite:PUB00016941], [cite:PUB00016947], [cite:PUB00016946]].



LuxR-type HTH proteins can be activated by one of four different mechanisms:



1) Regulators which belong to a two-component sensory transduction system where the protein is activated by its phosphorylation, generally on an aspartate residue, by a transmembrane kinase [[cite:PUB00016942], [cite:PUB00016943]]. Some proteins that belong to this category are:



Rhizobiaceae fixJ (global regulator inducing expression of nitrogen-fixation genes in microaerobiosis)

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium uhpA (activates hexose phosphate transport gene uhpT)

E. coli narL and narP (activate nitrate reductase operon)

Enterobacteria rcsB (regulation of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in enteric and plant pathogenesis)

Bordetella pertussis bvgA (virulence factor)

Bacillus subtilis coma (involved in expression of late-expressing competence genes)



 

2) Regulators which are activated, or in very rare cases repressed, when bound to N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are used as quorum sensing molecules in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00016944]]:



V. fischeri luxR (activates bioluminescence operon)

Agrobacterium tumefaciens traR (regulation of Ti plasmid transfer)

Erwinia carotovora carR (control of carbapenem antibiotics biosynthesis)

E. carotovora expR (virulence factor for soft rot disease; activates plant tissue macerating enzyme genes)

Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasR (activates elastase gene lasB)

Leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase (LFTR), a close relative of the non-ribosomal peptidyltransferases; there is a deletion of the N-terminal half of the N-terminal NAT-like domain after the domain duplication/swapping events [[cite:PUB00040115]].
Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme, which may have evolved a different function for this domain, although the putative active site maps to the same location in the common fold.
Arginine N-succinyltransferase, alpha chain, AstA, which contains an extra C-terminal domain that is similar to the double-psi β-barrel fold domain (missing one strand and untangled ψ-loops).


Several proteins carry a duplication of this domain, which consists of two NAT-like domains swapped with the C-terminal strands, including:


N-myristoyl transferase (NMT) [[cite:PUB00026039]].

The DNA-binding HTH domain is usually located in the C-terminal region; the N-terminal region often containing an autoinducer-binding domain or a response regulatory domain. Most luxR-type regulators act as transcription activators, but some can be repressors or have a dual role for different sites. LuxR-type HTH regulators control a wide variety of activities in various biological processes.



The luxR-type, DNA-binding HTH domain forms a four-helical bundle structure. The HTH motif comprises the second and third helices, known as the scaffold and recognition helix, respectively. The HTH binds DNA in the major groove, where the N-terminal part of the recognition helix makes most of the DNA contacts. The fourth helix is involved in dimerisation of gerE and traR. Signalling events by one of the four activation mechanisms described below lead to multimerisation of the regulator. The regulators bind DNA as multimers [[cite:PUB00016941], [cite:PUB00016947], [cite:PUB00016946]].



LuxR-type HTH proteins can be activated by one of four different mechanisms:



1) Regulators which belong to a two-component sensory transduction system where the protein is activated by its phosphorylation, generally on an aspartate residue, by a transmembrane kinase [[cite:PUB00016942], [cite:PUB00016943]]. Some proteins that belong to this category are:



Rhizobiaceae fixJ (global regulator inducing expression of nitrogen-fixation genes in microaerobiosis)

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium uhpA (activates hexose phosphate transport gene uhpT)

E. coli narL and narP (activate nitrate reductase operon)

Enterobacteria rcsB (regulation of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in enteric and plant pathogenesis)

Bordetella pertussis bvgA (virulence factor)

Bacillus subtilis coma (involved in expression of late-expressing competence genes)



 

2) Regulators which are activated, or in very rare cases repressed, when bound to N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are used as quorum sensing molecules in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00016944]]:



V. fischeri luxR (activates bioluminescence operon)

Some bacteria can contain up to as many as 200 two-component systems that need tight regulation to prevent unwanted cross-talk [[cite:PUB00042805]]. These pathways have been adapted to response to a wide variety of stimuli, including nutrients, cellular redox state, changes in osmolarity, quorum signals, antibiotics, and more [[cite:PUB00010651]]. Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]]. The HK catalyses its own auto-phosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. Some HK are bifunctional, catalysing both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their cognate RR. The input stimuli can regulate either the kinase or phosphatase activity of the bifunctional HK.

A variant of the two-component system is the phospho-relay system. Here a hybrid HK auto-phosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to an internal receiver domain, rather than to a separate RR protein. The phosphoryl group is then shuttled to histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) and subsequently to a terminal RR, which can evoke the desired response [[cite:PUB00042806], [cite:PUB00042807]]. This entry represents a structural domain usually found at the C-terminal of bipartite response regulators. These proteins are known to bind to DNA and RNA polymerases, and their N-terminal receiver domain belongs to the CheY family.
