WHN66045.1,CDD,cd06170,NA,"C-terminal DNA-binding domain of LuxR-like proteins. This domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and binds DNA. Proteins belonging to this group are response regulators; some act as transcriptional activators, others as transcriptional repressors. Many are active as homodimers. Many are two domain proteins in which the DNA binding property of the C-terminal DNA binding domain is modulated by modifications of the N-terminal domain.  For example in the case of Lux R which participates in the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density (quorum-sensing), a signaling molecule, the pheromone Acyl HSL (N-acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone), binds to the N-terminal domain and leads to LuxR dimerization.  For others phophorylation of the N-terminal domain leads to multimerization, for example Escherichia coli NarL and Sinorhizobium melilot FixJ. NarL controls gene expression of many respiratory-related operons when environmental nitrate or nitrite is present under anerobic conditions. FixJ is involved in the transcriptional activation of nitrogen fixation genes. The group also includes small proteins which lack an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Bacillus subtilis GerE.  GerE is dimeric and acts in conjunction with sigmaK as an activator or a repressor modulating the expression of various genes in particular those encoding the spore-coat. These LuxR family regulators may share a similar organization of their target binding sites. For example the LuxR dimer binds the lux box, a 20bp inverted repeat, GerE dimers bind two 12bp consensus sequences in inverted orientation having the central four bases overlap, and the NarL dimer binds two 7bp inverted repeats separated by 2 bp.

MTAN is involved in methionine and S-adenosyl-methionine recycling, polyamine biosynthesis, and bacterial quorum sensing. This subfamily belongs to the nucleoside phosphorylase-I (NP-I) family, whose members accept a range of purine nucleosides as well as the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine. The NP-1 family  includes phosphorolytic nucleosidases, such as purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPs, EC. 2.4.2.1), uridine phosphorylase (UP, EC 2.4.2.3), and 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP, EC 2.4.2.28), and hydrolytic nucleosidases, such as AMP nucleosidase (AMN, EC 3.2.2.4), and 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/SAH) nucleosidase (MTAN, EC 3.2.2.16).

They also cleave 5'-deoxyadenosine, a by-product of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes, into 5-deoxyribose and adenine. This activity is crucial for preventing the toxic accumulation of 5'-deoxyadenosine, which inhibits radical SAM enzymes such as biotin synthase and lipoic acid synthase.
