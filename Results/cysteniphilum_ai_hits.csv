WHN66683.1,PANTHER,PTHR46832,5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase,"The MtnN subfamily proteins are enzymes that catalyze the irreversible cleavage of the glycosidic bond in 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH/AdoHcy), producing adenine and the corresponding thioribose, 5'-methylthioribose, and S-ribosylhomocysteine. They also cleave 5'-deoxyadenosine, a by-product of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes, into 5-deoxyribose and adenine. This activity is crucial for preventing the toxic accumulation of 5'-deoxyadenosine, which inhibits radical SAM enzymes such as biotin synthase and lipoic acid synthase. The MtnN subfamily belongs to the larger PNP/UDP phosphorylase family and plays key roles in S-adenosylmethionine recycling and autoinducer-2 biosynthesis, which is part of bacterial quorum sensing.",5'-methylthioadenosine/adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase [Cysteiniphilum sp. QT6929]
WHN65752.1,PANTHER,PTHR32196,ABC transporter permease component,"This family of proteins is involved in the transport of various substrates across cellular membranes. They are part of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complexes, which are typically composed of multiple subunits that work together to import or export substrates. The proteins in this family are likely responsible for the translocation of substrates, which include sugars such as fructose, ribose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, and autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a molecule involved in bacterial quorum sensing. These permease proteins are integral membrane components and are essential for the high-affinity uptake of nutrients and other compounds, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and communication.",ribose ABC transporter permease [Cysteiniphilum sp. QT6929]
WHN65690.1,PFAM,PF01594,AI-2E family transporter,"This family includes four different proteins from  E. coli alone. One of them, YdgG or TqsA, has been shown to mediate transport of the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer 2 (AI-2). It is not clear if TqsA enhances secretion of AI-2 or inhibits AI-2 uptake. By altering the intracellular concentration of AI-2, TqsA affects gene expression in biofilms and biofilm formation [[cite:PUB00076990]]. TsqA belongs to the AI-2 exporter (AI-2E) superfamily [[cite:PUB00076989]].",AI-2E family transporter [Cysteiniphilum sp. QT6929]
WHN65753.1,PANTHER,PTHR46847,Bacterial solute-binding protein 2,"The bacterial solute-binding protein 2 family is involved in the transport of various sugars and signaling molecules across the bacterial cell membrane. Members of the family are typically part of ABC transporter complexes, which are responsible for the high-affinity uptake of specific substrates. These proteins bind to a range of molecules including D-apiose, ribose, fructose, mannose, xylose, xylitol, arabinose, galactofuranose, autoinducer 2, D-allose, D-threitol, and potentially rhizopine. The binding of these substrates suggests a role in nutrient acquisition, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing, reflecting the diverse metabolic needs and signaling mechanisms of bacteria. Some family members are also implicated in the induction of operons related to specific metabolic pathways, further underscoring their importance in bacterial physiology.",ribose ABC transporter substrate-binding protein RbsB [Cysteiniphilum sp. QT6929]
